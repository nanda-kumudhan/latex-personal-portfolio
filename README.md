# Nanda Kumudhan - Personal Portfolio

This is a modern, responsive portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and styled with a glassmorphism design. The portfolio content is dynamically generated by parsing a LaTeX CV, ensuring that the website is always up-to-date with the latest information.

## Features

- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Sleek, modern design with frosted-glass effects.
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Automated CV Parsing**: Automatically updates portfolio content by reading directly from a `cv.tex` file at build time.
- **Vercel Analytics**: Integrated with Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights for performance monitoring.
- **Sections**: Includes Home, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, and a Contact form.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **LaTeX Parsing**: `unified`, `unified-latex`
- **Deployment**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/nanda-kumudhan/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    This command will download and install all the project dependencies listed in `package.json`, including React, Next.js, and the LaTeX parsing libraries.
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Add your CV:**
    Place your LaTeX CV file in the `data/` directory and name it `cv.tex`.

    **Note:** The parsing script in `scripts/parse-cv.mjs` is configured to work with specific LaTeX commands (`\cvschool`, `\cventry`, `\cvproject`, `\cvskills`). If your CV uses different commands, you will need to update the script to match them.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    This command will start the Next.js development server. It will first run the `prebuild` script to parse your `cv.tex` and generate `data/portfolio-data.json`.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

5.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your portfolio.

## Automated CV Parsing

This project is designed to automate content updates. Instead of manually editing the website's code, you only need to update your `cv.tex` file.

- The script at `scripts/parse-cv.mjs` reads `data/cv.tex`.
- It extracts the relevant sections (Education, Experience, etc.).
- It writes the structured data to `data/portfolio-data.json`.
- The `prebuild` script in `package.json` ensures this process runs automatically every time you build the project (`npm run build`).

This means your deployed website will always reflect the current state of your LaTeX CV.

## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the platform created by the makers of Next.js.

To deploy:
1. Push your code to your GitHub repository.
2. Go to the Vercel dashboard and import your repository.
3. Vercel will automatically detect that it is a Next.js project, run the `build` command (which includes the CV parsing step), and deploy your site.
